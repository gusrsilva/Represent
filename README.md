# Represent!

An app for people in the US to see the representatives for their area, or any area in the US. The app shows the representatives info along with one of their recent tweets, and offers more info such as committees they are on or bills they have sponsored. There is also an Android Wear companion app that displays the representatives name, party, and type, as well as shows the 2012 election results for the current area. In addition, when the watch is shook, a random location is chosen and the phone and watch are updated to reflect the information of the representatives from the random location that is chosen.
